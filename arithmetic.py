# Arithmetic Operators in Python
a = 15    # Assign 15 to variable a
b = 4     # Assign 4 to variable b

add_result = a + b        # Addition: adds a and b
sub_result = a - b        # Subtraction: subtracts b from a
mul_result = a * b        # Multiplication: multiplies a and b
div_result = a / b        # Division: divides a by b (returns float)
mod_result = a % b        # Modulus: remainder when a is divided by b
exp_result = a ** b       # Exponentiation: a raised to the power of b
floor_div_result = a // b # Floor Division: divides a by b and returns the integer part

# Printing the results with explanations
print("a + b =", add_result)           # Prints the result of addition
print("a - b =", sub_result)           # Prints the result of subtraction
print("a * b =", mul_result)           # Prints the result of multiplication
print("a / b =", div_result)           # Prints the result of division
print("a % b =", mod_result)           # Prints the remainder of division
print("a ** b =", exp_result)          # Prints the result of exponentiation
print("a // b =", floor_div_result)    # Prints the result
