<summary><b>1. What are the features of python language ? </b></summary> <b>Answer:</b>

### Dynamically Typed:
Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variable types are determined at runtime rather than during declaration. This offers flexibility in coding but requires careful handling of data types.

### Interpreted Language:
Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, eliminating the need for a separate compilation step. This facilitates rapid development and debugging.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Python fully supports OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling the creation of modular and reusable code.

### Platform Independent:
Python code can run on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification, promoting code portability.
