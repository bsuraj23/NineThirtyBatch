HISTORY OF PYTHON:  Python was created in 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI, Netherlands, and released in 1991 as a simple, easy-to-read, and powerful programming language.support for both procedural and object-oriented programming.It evolved through major versions—Python 1.0 (1994), Python 2.0 (2000) with features like list comprehensions and Unicode, and Python 3.0 (2008), which modernized the language but broke backward compatibility. Today, Python is one of the most widely used languages in the world, especially in web development, automation, data science, AI, and machine learning, with continuous improvements in speed and usability.

 the famous web application developed using python is INSTAGRAM.

 Compilation means translating the code written by a programmer (source code) into machine code (binary code) that a computer processor can directly understand and execute.

1. 5 commands to implement the CMD 

 dir → Shows list of files and folders in the current directory.
cd <folder_name> → Changes directory (move into another folder).
mkdir <folder_name> → Creates a new folder.
del <filename> → Deletes a file.
cls → Clears the command prompt screen.
 
 2.In Python, there is no separate char datatype .Instead, a single character is treated as a string of length 1.

3. FEATURES OF PYTHON:
1.SIMPLE: python is written in simple english.
2.EASY TO LEARN: syntax of python easy to understanded by begineers.
3. high level language: python code written in general english.
4. dynamic: In python type of variable can be fixed at run time.
5.portable: python code can runs in different operating systems.
6.open source: python is a open source and free.
7. object oriented : python supports class, object, interpretation and it’s Supports multiple programming paradigms.
8. libraries :A huge community provides tutorials, libraries, and help for any problem.

1. Compilation means Converts the whole program into machine code at once before execution. Interpretation means Executes code line by line at runtime

2. VS Code is a lightweight powerful code editor used for many languages with debugging extensions and Git support.

    SHORTCUTS

   ctrl+c
   
   ctrl+v

   ctrl+T

   Ctrl + Shift + N

   Ctrl + Shift + p

   ctrl+/

4.  = is Assignment operator that is stores a value in a variable.
 
   == is Comparison operator checks equality between two values.

1.  break is Immediately stops the excecution of the loop and exit from the loop.

 continue  means Skips the current iteration and excecute the next iteration.

 2. %d, %f, %s, %t, \n These are format specifiers / escape sequences 

%d → Integer 

%f → Floating-point 

%t → Used in some languages for date/time

\n → Newline

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) used to transfer data between a web browser and a server. It is not secure (data can be read by others).

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)  it is same as HTTP, but adds encryption (SSL/TLS) so data is secure, private, and trusted.

A search engine works in 3 steps:

Crawling → Bots (spiders) scan the internet and collect pages.
Indexing → Collected pages are stored in a huge database (index).
Ranking & Retrieval → When you search, it matches your query with the index and shows results ranked by relevance.

1.list contains the insertion order,it allows duplicate values, it having indexing and slicing ,list is mutable
set does not having insertion order, it does not allow duplicate values, there is no indexing,set is mutable

2.remove() → Removes an element, but raises an error if it’s missing. discard() → Removes an element, but does nothing if it’s missing.

3.What is the purpose of the symbol :: in set()? start → where slicing begins (default = 0). stop → where slicing ends (default = end of sequence). step → the interval between elements (default = 1).[start : stop : step]

tuple is mutable or not
Tuple is immutable because Python has designed it to be a fixed collection.Once created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.

 1.RAG means Retrieval Augmented Generation.
It is a method in Artificial Intelligence (AI) where the system combines. Retrieval means Searching for information from a database/documents and generation means Using AI model like ChatGPT, gemini AI, meta AI to generate an answer.Tts like a database it cantain the all information when any one ask question then it will give the answer in one or two seconds.

1.In Python, there is no functional difference between using single quotes (') and double quotes (") to define a string. Both 'hello' and "hello" create identical string objects. The choice between them is largely a matter of style or convenience, especially when a string itself contains either a single or a double quote.If a string contains a single quote, it's often more convenient to enclose it in double quotes or If a string contains a double quote, it's often more convenient to enclose it in single quotes.

1.self refers to the instance of the class that is currently being used. It allows access to instance variables and methods inside the class.

Q2.To restart the vscode we have a shortcut i.e crtl+shift+P but this dosenot change the cache. Inorder to change the cache the process must be done manually Q3.How can you print all the attributes of a function? We can use dir() function to print all the attributes of a function which gives the directry ex: print(dir(my_func)
