5.Program for reverse a string by using for and while loop:
  Using for loop:
              text = "hello"
              reversed_text = ""

              for char in text:
                    reversed_text = char + reversed_text   

              print("Original String:", text)
              print("Reversed String:", reversed_text)


Using while loop:
            text = "python"
            reversed_text = ""

            i = len(text) - 1   # start from last index
            while i >= 0:
                 reversed_text += text[i]   
                 i -= 1

            print("Original String:", text)
            print("Reversed String:", reversed_text)
