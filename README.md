Q1 the difference between interpreter and compiler :
interpreter:Translates and runs code line by line,Executes the program directly without converting the entire code to machine language first,Slower because it translates code on the fly.
compiler:Translates the entire source code into machine code before running it,Generates an executable file that runs independently,Faster once compiled, since the translation happens only once.

Q2 about vscode and there shortcuts
Visual Studio Code is a free, lightweight, and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft, widely used by developers for:
*Writing and editing code
*Debugging
*Running terminals
*Using extensions for different programming languages

 Q3various technologies of data base

2)NoSQL Database Technologies
3)NewSQL Databases
4)Time Series Databases
5)Object-Oriented Databases
6)Multimodel Databases
7)Cloud Database Technologies

Q6 the difference between lists and sets 
  lists :
    1) ordered
    2)allows duplicates
    3)mutable
    4)indexing and slicing
    5)use case
  sets :
    1)unordered
    2)not allows duplicates
    3)mutable
    4)fast lookup

Q7 the difference between remove and discard
   The key difference between the remove and discard methods in Python sets is how they handle trying to remove an element that is not present in the set
Q8 what is the purpose of :: in sets
   The double colon :: in Python is used as a slice operator for sequences like lists, strings, and tuples. It allows for slicing with a specified step, meaning it    can skip elements while iterating through the sequence.
Q9 make a presentation on the topics dictionary,set,list,tuple
   Python provides several built-in data structures to organize and store data. Four fundamental types are
   1)Dictionary
   2)Set
   3)List
   4)Tuple
  These structures differ in properties like ordering, mutability, duplication allowance, and indexing
Q10 check whether tuple is mutable or not
    Tuples in Python are immutable. This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. Attempting to modify an element in      a tuple will raise a TypeError.
Q11 test the four features of dictionary and get hands on by applying in program    
      1)Dictionary holds data as key-value pairs.
      2)Supports value access via keys.
      3)Dictionary is mutable .
      4)Keys are unique; updating a key changes its value
Q12 about RAG
Q13 find the possible ways to print list without object.
Q14 without using sorting techniques write a code which can sort the list of interges
Q15 find the difference between  "" and ''
     1)Both represent string literals and behave identically in Python.
     2)Single quotes are often chosen when the string contains double quotes inside, to avoid escaping.
     3)Double quotes are preferred when the string contains single quotes/apostrophes inside, for the same reason.
Q16 correct the code "xyz=set(temp for i in range (2))"?
Q17 understand about self keyword?
     The self keyword in Python is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). It represents the instance of the class that is being created or          used. When an object is created from a class, self refers to that specific objec.
Q18 print the local variable of the function using attribute?
Q19 how can you restart vs code by clearing the cache
Q20 print all the attributes of a function
Q21 how many anotations in python
     Python supports various types of annotations mainly used for type hinting. These annotations are optional syntax that specify the expected data types of            variables, function parameters, and return types. They help tools like type checkers, IDEs, and linters provide better error detection and code completion.
Q22 how can we check the processor through python
