HISTORY OF PYTHON:  Python was created in 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI, Netherlands, and released in 1991 as a simple, easy-to-read, and powerful programming language.support for both procedural and object-oriented programming.It evolved through major versions—Python 1.0 (1994), Python 2.0 (2000) with features like list comprehensions and Unicode, and Python 3.0 (2008), which modernized the language but broke backward compatibility. Today, Python is one of the most widely used languages in the world, especially in web development, automation, data science, AI, and machine learning, with continuous improvements in speed and usability.

 the famous web application developed using python is INSTAGRAM.

 Compilation means translating the code written by a programmer (source code) into machine code (binary code) that a computer processor can directly understand and execute.

1. 5 commands to implement the CMD 

 dir → Shows list of files and folders in the current directory.
cd <folder_name> → Changes directory (move into another folder).
mkdir <folder_name> → Creates a new folder.
del <filename> → Deletes a file.
cls → Clears the command prompt screen.
 
 2.In Python, there is no separate char datatype .Instead, a single character is treated as a string of length 1.

3. FEATURES OF PYTHON:
1.SIMPLE: python is written in simple english.
2.EASY TO LEARN: syntax of python easy to understanded by begineers.
3. high level language: python code written in general english.
4. dynamic: In python type of variable can be fixed at run time.
5.portable: python code can runs in different operating systems.
6.open source: python is a open source and free.
7. object oriented : python supports class, object, interpretation and it’s Supports multiple programming paradigms.
8. libraries :A huge community provides tutorials, libraries, and help for any problem.

1. Compilation means Converts the whole program into machine code at once before execution. Interpretation means Executes code line by line at runtime

2. VS Code is a lightweight powerful code editor used for many languages with debugging extensions and Git support.

3.  = is Assignment operator that is stores a value in a variable.
   == is Comparison operator checks equality between two values.

tuple is mutable or not
Tuple is immutable because Python has designed it to be a fixed collection.Once created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
