1.python was created in 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI, Netherlands, and released in 1991 as a simple, easy to read, and powerfull programming language. support for both procedural and object-oriented programming.It evovlved though major versions-python 1.0 (1994),python 2.0 (2000) with features like list comprehensions and unicode,and python 3.0 (2008),which modernized the language but broke backward compatability.Python is one of the most widely used language in the world , especially in web development, automation , data science, AI and machine learning, with continous improvements in speed and usability.

2. Instagram is a famous web application.

3. Compilation is a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or data that are selected, coordinated,or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship. the term "compilation" includes collective works.

1. commands to implementthe CMD

dir -> Shows list of files and folders in the current directory.cd<folder_name> ->changes directory(move into another folder).mkdir<folder_name> ->Cretes a new folder.del -> deletes a file. cls ->clear the command prompt screen.


2.In python, there is no separate char datatype . instead, a single character is treated as a string of length 1 .


3.FEATURES OF PYTHON: 1.SIMPLE: PYTHON is written in simple english.2.EASY TO LEARN:syntax of python easy to uderstanded by begineers.

 
4.high level language: python code written in general english.

  
5. dynamic: In python type of variable can be fixed at run time.
   
6. portable:python code can runs in differnt operating systems.


3. python ie a popular, high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and versatility.
key features
 * East to Learn and Use
 * Open Source and free
 * Extensive Standard Library
 * Platform Independent
 * High-Level Language
 * Dynamicallt typed
 * Object-Oriented
 * Interpreted Language

 1. Compiler: A compiler is a program that  translate the entire source code of a program into machine code or an intermediate representation like bytecode before the program is run. It produces a separate executable file. It executable is platform-specific.
 
 Interpreted: An interpreter reads one statement of the program at a time,traslate it into machione code,and then executes it immediately before moving on to the next line. it executed line-by line by interpreter at runtime.


 2. VS code shortcuts
* Ctrl + Shift +p
* Ctrl + P
*  Ctrl + S
*  Ctrl + ,
*  CTRL + k, Ctrl + S


  3. =(Assignment Operator): This operator is used to assign a value to a variable.
     ==(Equality Comparison Operator): This operator is used to compare two values to see if they are equal.

1. A break statement terminates the entire loop in which its located. when a break is executed,the program immediately exits the loop and continues withthe first statements after the loop. it is often used to exit a loop early when a certain condition is met.

Continue: A continue statement skips the current iteration of a loop. when a continue is executed, the program jumps to the next iteratiom of the loop.

2. %d: used to format and print an integer value.
   %f: used to format and print a floatingpoint number.
   %s: used to format and print a string.
   %t: This is less common is standard C/C++ printf functions and might indicate a custom format specififer or a specfic librarys extension.in some contexts, it could relate to time or date formatting.
   %n: This represents a newline character,which moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line in the output.

   1. HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the world wide web. It is a protocol used to transmit hypertext messsages like web pages between a wed server and a web browser.


   HTTPS(Hypertext Transfer protocol Secure)is a secure version of HTTP.It add a layer of security by using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt the data exchanged between the browse and the server.this     encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted it cannot be read or tampered with by unauthorized parties.

   2. The search engine to discover content on the internet.Since there no central registry of all web pages, search engines use automated programs called crawlers also known as " bots" or "spiders"to explore the web.

   1. Elements are stored in a specific sequence. you can access elements by their integer index.
   2. you can have multiple occurrences of the same element in a list.
   3. you can add,remove ,or change elements in a list after it has been created.

      set

  1.Elemente do not have a specific position or index . you cannot access element by their index.
  2.A set automatically ensures that all elements are unique. if you try to add a duplicate element, it will simply be ingored.

  2.remove() → Removes an element, but raises an error if it’s missing. discard() → Removes an element, but does nothing if it’s missing.

3.What is the purpose of the symbol :: in set()? start → where slicing begins (default = 0). stop → where slicing ends (default = end of sequence). step → the interval between elements (default = 1).

   (25/08/25) 
   1.Tuple is mutable or not Tuple is immutable because Python has designed it to be a fixed collection.Once created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.

1.RAG means Retrieval Augmented Generation. It is a method in Artificial Intelligence (AI) where the system combines. Retrieval means Searching for information from a database/documents and generation means Using AI model like ChatGPT, gemini AI, meta AI to generate an answer.Tts like a database it cantain the all information when any one ask question then it will give the answer in one or two seconds.

1.In Python, there is no functional difference between using single quotes (') and double quotes (") to define a string. Both 'hello' and "hello" create identical string objects. The choice between them is largely a matter of style or convenience, especially when a string itself contains either a single or a double quote.If a string contains a single quote, it's often more convenient to enclose it in double quotes or If a string contains a double quote, it's often more convenient to enclose it in single quotes.

1.self refers to the instance of the class that is currently being used. It allows access to instance variables and methods inside the class.

Q2.To restart the vscode we have a shortcut i.e crtl+shift+P but this dosenot change the cache. Inorder to change the cache the process must be done manually Q3.How can you print all the attributes of a function? We can use dir() function to print all the attributes of a function which gives the directry ex: print(dir(my_func)

(1/09/25) 

1.In Python to modify an existing global variable within a function, the global keyword is used to explicitly declare that the variable being referenced is the global one, not a new local variable.

2.We can represent hexadecimal numbers in Python using the 0x prefix.Python provides built-in functions to convert from Base 10 integer to Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal representations. The respective functions are bin() , oct() and hex() — the returned values are of String type prefixed with the corresponding base: 0b for bin() , 0o for oct() and 0x for hex().

3.To obtain all attributes of a function in Python, the dir() built-in function is commonly used. difference types of attributes of functions is 1.'annotations' 2.'builtins' 3.'call' 4.'closure' 5.'code' 6.'defaults' 7.'dict' 8.'doc' 9.'get' 10.'globals' 11.'name' 12.'qualname' 13.'reduce' 14. 'repr' 15'setattr' 16'sizeof' 17'str' 18'subclasshook'

4.OpenAI is an AI company that builds and releases very smart computer programs. Think of it as a factory for advanced artificial intelligence. ex: chatgpt

(2/09/25)

1.The factorial of zero is 1.

2.A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as it does forward. Punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are usually ignored when checking for palindromes. ex:racecar,madam,level,kayak,rotator

3.To purge means to remove something or someone that is unwanted, harmful, or considered "impure". This implies cleansing or removal, which can occur in several contexts. ex: a=35 but it can't used in entire code then it removed.

4.In Python, a "conflict" is not a specific error but rather a general term for when different parts of your code or project clash.

(3/09/25)

1.error : error is syntax or semantic mistake and system problem it can be raised while compile time

exception: exception is a run time error or Unexpected event at runtime can be handled using try, catch,finally blocks

2.Python having Two main types of exceptions there are : built in exceptions and user defined exceptions

3.None is not a datatype.It is a special constant and an object of NoneType.

4.five pillors of oops are:

Class

Object

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

(8/09/25)

 A reference variable is just a name that refers to an object stored in memory. In Python, variables don’t store the object itself, they store the reference (address) to that object.
2.What is the self keyword? self represents the current instance of the class.It is used to access variables and methods of the object.Python automatically passes self as the first parameter in instance methods.

3. A website is a collection of related web pages hosted on a server, accessible via a domain. A web browser (like Chrome, Firefox) is software that retrieves and displays websites for users.

4.List different types of web browsers and difference between them. Common browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera. Chrome → fast, widely used, Google integration. Firefox → privacy focused, open source. Edge → built on Chromium, Windows integration. Safari → optimized for Apple devices. Opera → lightweight, built-in VPN/ad blocker.
