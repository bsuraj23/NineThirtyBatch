1.HISTORY OF PYTHON:python was created in 1989 by guido van Rossum at CWI,netherland, and realeased in 1991
as asimple,easy-to-read and powerful programming language.first version of python(0.9.0)released it already had 
features like functions,exception handling,and the core datetype(str,list,dict,)along with modules.present has become
the most popular programming language in the world.widely used in web development,data science,AI\ML,automation,scientific
computing and education.python 2.0 was released list comprehension, garbage collection(using reference counting cycle detecting
 and support unicode

the famous web application developed using python is instargram,you tube

complication means translating the code written by a programmer(source code)into machine code(binary code) a computer processor
can directly understand and execute

(05-08-2025)
1.5 commands to implement the CMD
DIR: display a list of files and folders in the current disectory.CD change the current working directory(cd documents).CLS clears the command
prompt screen.COPY copies file from one  location to another(copy file1.txt.DEL Deletes one or more files(del file1.txt
2.IN python ,there is no separate char datatype. instead a single character is treated as a string of length 1
3.FEATURES OF PYTHON:
* simple and easy to learn
* interpreted language
* cross platform
* high-level language
* object-oriented
* extensive libraries
* dynamic typing
* free and open source.

1.COMPILATION: the source code in python is saved as a.py file which is then compiled into format known as byte code,byte code is then
convert to machine code.after the compilation,the code stored in .pyc files and is regenerated when it update.
INTERPRETER:In python an interpreter is a program that directly executes code written in the python programminag language without requiring
it to be compiled into machine language first.the source code and converting it into instruction that the computer can understand and execute.
2.visual studio code(vs code) is hightweight , and powerful code editor developed by microsoft it support multiple programming languages
* ctrl + N :new file
* ctrl + S :save file
* ctrl + W :close file
* ctrk + F : find
* ctrl + H : replace.

(14-08-2025)
1.BREAK STATEMENT:the  purpose of break statement is it is used to terminate(exit) the loop immediately.after break,control goes to the first
statement outside the loop.it is often used when a certian condition is met and you dont want to continue looping
CONTINUE STATEMENT:the purpose of continue statement is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.It does not
stop the loop,only skips the remaining code for that iteration.

2.explore about
1.%d is used to print an integer (decimal number)
2.%f is used to print floating point number
3.%s is used to print a string
4.%t is used with date/time formatting
5.\n is an escape sequence used to insert a new line.

(18-08-2025)
1.HTTP:stand for hyper text transfer protocol.A protocol used for transferring data(web pages,text,images,)it is between the web browser and web server.
it work on port 80 .faster no encrypted and decrypted
HTTPS: stands for  hypertext transfer protocol secure it uses ssl/tls encryption to keep data safe during transfer its work port number 443 and it is 
sensitive data(banking, login, shopping)
2.A search engin like google,bing,yahoo and its work on three steps
search engin=crawling+indexing+ranking.

(19-08-2025)
1.LIST :it is ordered collection of items.*allows duplicate element.*elements can be accessed using index.*syntax:list =[1, 2, 2, 3]
SET: unordered collection of unique element.does not allow duplicates.elements cannot be accessed using index because it is unordered.syntax:set1={1, 4, 3}
2.remove(): if you want to be warned when the element is missing.
 discard():if you want to aviod errors when the element might not be in the set.
 3.the symbol :: is not specific to sets in python-it actually comes from slicing notation used with sequence like tuple,and strings
 
 (25-08-2025)
 1.TUPLE:In python a *** is immutable, which means once tuple is created, its element cannot be changed, added,or removed
 list is mutable,tuple is immutable.
 2.FEATURES OF DICTIONARY:
* unordered as python 3.7,insertion order is preserved
* mutable we can change values,add or remove items
* key are unique no duplicates allowed;later key overwrites earlier one
* key must be immutable is like string number,tuple.

1.RAG stands for retrieval-augmented generation it uses AI technique that combines two things,
  Retrieval:searching relevent information from a knowledeg base
  Generation:using like language mode(like GPT) to generate ansewrs based on both.
  RAG ensure outputs are more reliable,factual,and up-to-up data compared to a models generating purely from memory.

  1.If the string contain a single quote ', use double quotes " ".if your string contains a double quote ",use single quotes ''.if your string contains
  both'and", you can use escape character with triple code.                       ,

1.SELF KEYWORD:In python the self keyword is very important when working with classes and object.self represents the current instance of the class.it is used
to acces variableand methods that belong to the same object .

2.ATTRIBUTES OF FUNCTION:In python a function itself is an object and like any object it has attributes.we can use the dir()function to print all the
attributes of function which gives the directly ex print(dir(my-func)).

3.VS CODE: To insert we have a shortcut i e crtl+shift+p but this doesnot change the chace.Inorder to change the cache the process must be done manually.

(1-09-2025).

1.IN python to modify a global variable inside a function you must declare it using the global keyword.use global varname inside the function before assingning
to it.without global,python will treat it as a local variable.globals are useful sometimes but overusing them makes code harder to manage better to return
value instead.

2.NUMBER TYPES IN PYTHON:ordinary numbers these are the normal numbers we use every day(base 10).digits 0-9.octal number use the digits 0-7 onlyin the python
octal numbers are written with prefix(zero+small).hexadecimal number is use base is 16 digits 0-9 and A-F(or a-f) in python,hexa decimal number are written
with perfix 0x.complex number have a real part and an imaginary part.in the python imaginary unit is represented by j.

3.openAI is an artifical intelligence research and deployment company.one of the most popular AI products from openAI is chatgpt,DALL.E(for AI art and image
generation)WHISPER(for speech-to-text),CODEX (code generation help).

 (2-09-2025 ).
 1.The factorial of zero is 1.by definition n!=n(n-1)base case 0!=1 there exactly one way to arrange zero object 2.A palindrome is a word, number, phrase,or
 sequence that reads the same forward and backward( ignoring spaces punctuation,and capitalization in many cases).
 
 3.The word purge means to remove or get rid of something unwanted.to clean out or eliminate something undesirable 4.A conflict is a disagreement clash,or problem
 that happens when two or more people,ideas or thinks.A.stay calm and listen carefully.B.communicate clearly without blaming.C.find a compromise or middle ground.
