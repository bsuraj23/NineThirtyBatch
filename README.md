## Frequently Asked Questions (Python)

### 1. What are variables in Python?

**Answer:**  
In Python, variables are used to store data values. You do not need to declare the type of a variable explicitly; Python automatically assigns the data type based on the value you provide. Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore and are case-sensitive. For example, you can create variables to store numbers, text, or other data.

### 2. How do you take user input in Python?

**Answer:**  
In Python, you can take user input using the `input()` function. This function waits for the user to type something and press Enter, then returns the input as a string. You can store this input in a variable for further use in your program.

### 3. What are data types in Python? Give some examples.

**Answer:**  
Data types in Python represent the kind of value a variable holds. Common Python data types include:
- `int` for whole numbers (e.g., 10)
- `float` for decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)
- `str` for text (e.g., "hello")
- `bool` for boolean values (True or False)
Python automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned to a variable.

### 4. How do you convert user input to an integer in Python?

**Answer:**  
Since the `input()` function always returns a string, you can convert user input to an integer using the `int()` function. This allows you to perform mathematical operations on the user's input if it represents a number.

### 5. Can you change the value of a variable after it is created in Python?

**Answer:**  
Yes, in Python, you can change the value stored in a variable at any time by assigning a new value to it. The variable will then hold the new value, regardless of its previous value or data type.
