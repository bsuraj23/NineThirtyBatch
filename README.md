1.what are the python's key features?Why it is called an interpreted language?->simple & easy to learn->Interpreted language->Dynamically Typed->Object-oriented->Extensive libraries->Cross-platform->High level language python is executed line by line so it is called as interpreted language
2.Difference between Python 2 and Python 3?Ans.Python2:->In python 2 print is a statement->The result of division is floor division Python 3:->In python 3 print is a function->The result of division is actual division
3.Explain indentation in Python.What happens if indentation is incorrect?ans.Indentation means space or tabs at the beginning of a line of code in Python,indentation is part of the syntax it tells Python which statements belong together in a block,common indentation is four spaces if indentation is incorrect then it raises syntax and indentation error at runtime
4.What are the python keywords?Can you use them as variable names ? ANS.The python keywords are if,for,while,else,def,class,return,true,none No,we can't use them as variable names
5.Differnece between list,tuple,set and dictionary.Give examples?Ans.List-insertion Order is Preserved,Duplicates are allowed it is mutable,it is represented by "[]"
Tuple insertion order is preserved,Duplicates are allowed,it is immutable,it is represented by "()"
Set-Insertion order is preserved,Duplicates are allowed it is mutable,it is represented by"{}"
Dictionary-As of 3.7 Insertion order is preserved,keys must be unique values can repeat,it is mutable,it is represented by "{}"
6.What is the difference between mutable and immutable data types?Ans.Mutable datatypes that can be modified or changed after the creation Ex:list,set,dictionary Immutable datatyes that cannot be modidfied after the creation
Ex:int,string,tuple
7.Explain== vs is operator in Python with examples?Ans."=="is the equality operator it checks whether the values of two objects are equal."is" is the identity operator it checks whether two names(variables)refers to the exacts same object in memory
8.What is the difference between append() vs Extend() in lists?Ans.list.append(x) adds its argument x as a single element to the end of the list.extend(iterable)takes an iterable like another list,tuple,string and adds each element
9.Explain shallow copy vs deep copy in Python?Ans.shallow copy:creates a new container/object,but does not copy the nested(inner)objects.It just copies references to the inner objects.so the outer object is a separate object,but the inner ones are shared between original and copy.Deep copy:creates a new container/object and recursively copies all objects found in the original.So neither the outer nor any inner/mutable parts are shared.The copy is fully independent.
10.How does Python handle memory management(Garbage collection)?Ans.Memory management refers to how python allocates memory to objects,how it keeps track of what can be used and howmit reclaims unused memory.Python makes most of this automatic so you usually dont need to manually free memory(unlike in C).
11.What are the Python's built in data types?Ans.int,float,complex,string,list,tuple,range,dict,set,frozenset,boolean,none
12.How are integers and flaots stored in memory in Python?Ans.Integers in python are stored as arbitrary-precision objects (with a header+an array of "digits"),growing in size as needed,but Floats are stored as 64-bit IEEE-754 double-precision values inside a Python object with metadata.
13.what is the difference between break,continue and pass?Ans.Break:When a condition is given if the condition is true it comes outside the loop.Continue:When a condition is given if we use continue then it only skips the number that matches the condition and continue the loop.Pass:Does nothing,it's a no-operation placeholder,it's only useful where syntactically some statement is required but you don't want any action.
14.What is the purpose of the else clause in loops?Ans.In python,loops(for and while)can have an else clause.The else block runs only if the loop completes normally,i.e. if no break was used to exit the loop early.
15.How do you use list comprehension in python?Ans.A list comprehension is a compact way to create a new list by applying an expression to items in an iterable,optionally filtering them.It combines a for loop,and optional if filtering,into a single line inside square brackets.
16.What is the difference between Exception & BaseException?Ans.BaseException:is the root of the built-in exception hierarchy.All built-in exceptions derive(directly or indirectly)from BaseException. it is the base class for most of the "normal"or "application-level"exceptions.
17.Explain try,except,finally,and else?Ans.The block of code where in you run operations that might raise exceptions.except:One or more blocks that handle certain exception types if they are raised in the try.else:If present runs only if the try block did not raise any exception.finally:If present,always executes after try,except,and else(if used),regardless of whether an exception was raised or not -useful for cleanup.
