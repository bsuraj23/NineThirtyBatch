1.what is the history of python? HISTORY OF PYTHON: python was created in 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI, Netherlands, and released in 1991 as a simple, easy-to-read, and powerful programming language. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It evolved through major versions--python 1.0(1994), python 2.0(2000) with features like list comprehensions and unicode, and python 3.0(2008), which modernized the language but broke backward compatibility. Widely used AI,machine learning, data science, web development, automation, and scientific computing.

2.What is the famous web application developed using python? The famous web application developed using python is INSTAGRAM.

3.What is compilation? Python's compilation process translates your source code into bytecode, which is then executed by the intrepreter. No separate compilation step is needed before running your code.

1.find any 5 commands to implement in the command prompt? -ipconfig:Displays all computer's IP/TCP address and network details, and also used to reset your pasword. -ping:Tests cennectivity to another network device or website. -cd(change directory):Navigates between folders in CMD. -dir:Lists files and folders in the current directory. -cls:clear the command prompt screen.

2.Check whether 'char' datatype exist in python or not? In python does not have a separate char datatype. Instead, a single character is treated as a string ( str ) of length 1.

3.What are the features of python? 
  * Easy to learn.
  * High-level language.
  * Interpreted.
  * Object-oriented.
  * Extensive libraries.
  * Cross-platform.

1.Difference between compilation and interpreter? 
  * Compilation means coverts the whole program into machine code at once before execution.
  * Interpreter means Executes code line by line at runtime.
    
2.Understand about VS code and the shortcuts? Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful, free, and lightweight code editor developed by Microsoft. It's used for various programming languages and is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  SHORTCUTS
  *ctrl+c
  *ctrl+v
  *ctrl+T
  *ctrl+shift+N
  *ctrl+shift+p
  
3.Find the difference between (=) and (==)? In python, (=) and (==) have different purposes: 
  *(=) is the assaignment operator, used to assign a value to a variable.
  *(==) is the equality comparison operator, used to check if two values are equal.

1.Difference between break and continue statements? 
  * The break statement is used to exit the loop entirely. when the program encounters break, it immediately terminates the       loop it's inside and continues execution at the next statement following the loop.
  * The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one.
    
2.Explore about %d,%f,%s,%t,/n? 
  * %d -> Integer
  * %f -> Floating-Point Number
  * %s -> String
  * %t -> Used in some languages for date&time
  * \n -> Newline.

1.Explore about http and https?
  * HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol) used to transfer data between a web browser and a server. It doesn't provide any          security.
  * HTTPS (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure) adds a security layer using SSL/TLS encryption, which ensures data privacy        and protection from attackers.
     
2.Find how does a search engine works? 
  A search engine operates in three main steps:
  * Crawling -> Search engines use automated programs called crawlers or spiders to systematically find new and updated web       pages.
  * Indexing -> It extracts keywords, images, and other information,and then organizes this data into a massive database          called the index.
  * Ranking -> When you search, it matches your query with the index and shows results ranked by relevance.

1.What is the difference between list and set?
LIST:

  * Lists maintain the order of elements.
  * List elements can be accessed using their index.
  * Lists can contain duplicate elements.
  * Supports indexing and slicing.
    
SET:
  * Sets do not maintain the order of elements.
  * Set elements cannot be accessed using their index.
  * Sets automatically eliminate duplicate elements.
  * Sets are mutable, means they can be modified after creation.
      
2.Difference between remove() and discard()? remove() -> Removes an element, but raises an error if it's missing. discard()-   > Removes an element, but does nothing if it's missing.

3.What is the purpose of the symbol :: in sets? Start -> where slicing begins (default = 0). Stop -> where slicing ends        (default = end of sequence). Step -> the interval between elements (default = 1). ex: sequence[start : stop : step].

1.Make a presentation on the topics dictionary, set, list, tuple?

LIST:
  * Elements have a defined order, which you can access using an index.
  * You can add, remove, or change elements after the list is created.
  * Lists can contain multiple identical elements.
  * Created with square brackets [].
    
TUPLE:
  * Just like lists, elements have a defined order.
  * You cannot change, add, or remove elemnts after the tuple is created.
  * Tuple can contain multiple identical elements.
  * Created with parentheses.
    
 SET:
  * Elements do not have a defined or index.
  * You can add or remove elements.
  * A set automatically removes any duplicate elements.
  * Created with curly braces {} or the set() function.

1.Check whether tuple is mutable or not? A tuple is immutable because once a tuple is created, you cannot change, add, or      remove its's elements. But, if a tuple contains mutable objects like lists or dictionaries then we can modify those          contents. 

2.Test the 4 features of dictionary and get hands on by applying in programs?
  * MUTABLE: Dictionaries cab be changed after they're created. you can add, remove, and modify key-value pairs.
  * UN-ORDERED(in python 3.6 and earlier): Items in a dictionary don't have a defined order. (in python 3.7+ dictionaries)       maintain insertion order, which means they are ordered.
  * KEY-VALUE PAIRS: Data is stored in key:value pairs. A key is used to access its corresponding value.
  * UNIQUE AND IMMUTABLE: Each key must be unique to pevent data conflicts . keys can only be immutable types like strings,      numbers, or tuples, not lists or other dictionaries.

1.Understand about RAG?
2.Find the possible ways to print list without object? hint: Use any loops?
3.Without using sorting techniques write a code which can sort the list of integers?

1.find the difference between " " and ' ' while using them for a string?
2.correct the code "xyz=set(temp for i in range (2))"?.
