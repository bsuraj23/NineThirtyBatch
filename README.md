Q1.Give any 5 commands of command prompt on windows.
   mkdir foldername:used to create one more directories
   del filename:deletes a file
   dir:list all files and folders in the current directory
   cd foldername:changes current directory to specified folder
   ipconfig:displays the computer's ip configuration
   
Q2.Give 5 features of python.
  ->easy to learn and readable syntax
  ->interpreted and dynamically typed
  ->high level language
  ->portable
  ->free and open source
  
Q3.Find if char datatype exist in python or not?
   No, Python does not have a separate char (character) data type. Instead, any single character is represented as a string of length 1, which belongs to the "str" type.

Q1.Difference between compiler and interpreter?
   compiler-A compiler is a program that translates the entire source code (written in a high-level language) into machine code  in one go, before execution.
   interpreter-An interpreter processes the source code line by line and executes it immediately without producing a separate executable file. Some interpreters convert source code to an intermediate form (like        bytecode) and execute that.
   
Q2.Difference Between = and ==?
   "=" is used to assign the value to any variable
   "==" is used to compare the variable to the value
   
Q3.How many types of range functions are there to use in loops?
   range(stop):with a single argument it starts from 0 till not including stop before the stop ex:for i in range(3) it gives values 0,1,2
   range(start,stop):it starts from start and end before the stop ex:for i in range(1,6) it gives the values 1,2,3,4,5
   range(start,stop,step):it starts from start and ends before the stop and increments by step ex:for i in range(1,15,3) it gives the values 1,4,7,10,13 if we want to count from backwards we will use for i in                                        range(15,1,-3) it gives the values 15,12,9,6,3.

Q1.Difference between break and continue statements?
   Break:break terminates the program according to the condition ex:for i in range(1,15) if we give the condition if i==5 then break then the output will be 1,2,3,4.
   Continue:continue only skips the value given in the condition and print the remaining as same ex:for i in range(1,7) if the condition is if i==3 then itb gives the output 1,2,4,5,6.
   
Q2.Explore about %d,%f,%s,%t,/n?
   %d used for the digit values,%s used for string values,%t used for tab values,/n is used for new line or next line,%f used for floating point numbers.

Q1.Explore about http and https?
   HTTP:http stands for hypertext transfer protocol,HTTP transmits data in plaintext, meaning that anyone monitoring the connection like on public Wi-Fi can intercept and read messages, including sensitive                information.
   HTTPS:https stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. it’s simply http layered over TLS (Transport Layer Security), sometimes referred to as SSL, its older counterpart it is very safe.
   
Q2.Find how does a search engine works?
   Search engines use automated bots (crawlers or spiders) to scan the web and discover new or updated content, which they then index into a massive searchable database. When you enter a query, the engine quickly    searches this index and uses ranking algorithms to return the most relevant results based on relevance, quality, and other factors.

Q1.What is the difference between list and set?
   LIST:Insertion order-preserved
        Duplicates-allowed
        Mutable-yes
   Set:Insertion order-not preserved
       Duplicates-not allowed
       Mutable-yes
       But Sets can only contain hashable (immutable) elements like numbers, strings, or tuples,they cannot include unhashable types like lists or dictionaries.
       
Q2.Difference between remove and discard?
   remove()-Attempts to remove the specified element from the set. If the element does not exist, it raises a Keyerror.
   discard()-Attempts to remove the specified element from the set. If the element does not exist, it does nothing no error is thrown.
   
Q3.What is the purpose of the symbol :: in sets?
   In Python,:: is part of extended slice syntax for sequences like lists, tuples, and strings. It appears as start:stop:step
   ex:my_list=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6] print my_list[::3] it gives the output 0,3,6.

Q1.Check whether tuple is mutable or not?
   In Python, a tuple is immutable that is  once created  you cannot change, add, or remove its elements it is mainly used for the files which should not be modified.

Q1.Understand about RAG?
   Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method where a language model (LLM) enhances its responses by pulling in information from external sources—like documents, databases, or websites right before             generating an answer,it is used in chatgpt and others to increase the real time knowledge.

# 🐍 Python Interview Questions (Beginner → Intermediate)
## 🔹 Python Basics

1. What are Python’s key features? Why is it called an interpreted language?

->easy and readable syntax
->Dynamically Typed
->Portable
->Interpreted Language
->Supports Object Oriented programming
->High Level Language
Python is executed line by line so it is called as interpreted language

2. Difference between **Python 2 and Python 3**?

Ans.Python 2:
    ->In python 2 print is a statement
    ->The result of division is floor division
   Python 3:
    ->In python 3 print is a function
    ->The result of division is actual division

3. Explain **indentation** in Python. What happens if indentation is incorrect?

Ans.Indentation means space or tabs at the beginning of a line of code In Python, indentation is part of the syntax it tells Python which statements belong together in a block,common indentation is four spaces
    if indentation is incorrect then it raises Syntax and Indentation error at Runtime,different blocks misgrouped (logical errors).

4. What are Python keywords? Can you use them as variable names?

Ans.The python keywords are if,for,while,else,def,class,return,true,none No,we can't use them as variable names

5. Difference between **list, tuple, set, and dictionary**. Give examples?

Ans.List-Insertion Order Is Preserved,Duplicates are allowed,it is mutable,It Is represented by "[]"
    Tuple-Insertion Order Is Preserved,Duplicates are allowed,it is immutable,it is represented by "()"
    Set-Insertion Order Is preserved,Duplicates are allowed,it is mutable,it is represented by "{}"
    Dictionary-As of 3.7 insertion order is preserved,Keys must be unique values can repeat,ii is mutable,it is represented by "{}"

6. What is the difference between **mutable and immutable** data types?

Ans.Mutable datatypes that can be modified or changed after the creation Ex:list,set,dictionary
    Immutable datatypes that cannot be modified after the creation Ex:int,string,tuple

7. Explain **== vs is** operator in Python with examples?

Ans."==" is the equality operator it checks whether the values of two objects are equal.
    "is" is the identity operator it checks whether two names (variables) refers to the exact same object in memory.

8. What is the difference between **append() vs extend()** in lists?

Ans.list.append(x) adds its argument x as a single element to the end of the list.
    list.extend(iterable) takes an iterable like another list, tuple, string and adds each element.

9. Explain **shallow copy vs deep copy** in Python?

Ans.Shallow copy: creates a new container/object, but does not copy the nested (inner) objects. It just copies references to the inner objects. So the outer object is a separate object, but the inner ones are        shared between original and copy.
    Deep copy: creates a new container/object and recursively copies all objects found in the original. So neither the outer nor any inner/mutable parts are shared. The copy is fully independent.

10. How does Python handle **memory management** (Garbage collection)?

Ans.Memory management refers to how Python allocates memory to objects, how it keeps track of what can be used and what can be freed, and how it reclaims unused memory. Python makes most of this automatic so you     usually don’t need to manually free memory (unlike in C).

11. What are Python’s built-in data types?

Ans.int,float,complex,string,list,tuple,range,dict,set,frozenset,boolean,None

12. How are integers and floats stored in memory in Python?

Ans.Integers in Python are stored as arbitrary‑precision objects (with a header + an array of “digits”), growing in size as needed,but Floats are stored as 64‑bit IEEE‑754 double‑precision values inside a Python object with metadata.

13. What is the difference between `break`, `continue`, and `pass`?

Ans.Break: When a condition is given if we use break then if the condition is true it comes outside the loop.
    Continue: When a condition is given if we use continue then it only skips the number that matches the condition and continue the loop.
    Pass: Does nothing ,it’s a no-operation placeholder ,It’s only useful where syntactically some statement is required but you don’t want any action.

14. What is the purpose of the `else` clause in loops?

Ans.In Python, loops (for and while) can have an else clause. The else block runs only if the loop completes normally, i.e. if no break was used to exit the loop early.

15. How do you use list comprehension in Python?

Ans.A list comprehension is a compact way to create a new list by applying an expression to items in an iterable, optionally filtering them. It combines a for loop, and optional if filtering, into a single line      inside square brackets.

16. What is the difference between `Exception` and `BaseException`?

Ans.BaseException: is the root of the built-in exception hierarchy. All built-in exceptions derive (directly or indirectly) from BaseException.
    Exception: is a subclass of BaseException. It is the base class for most of the “normal” or “application-level” exceptions.

17. Explain `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else`?

Ans.try: The block of code where in you run operations that might raise exceptions.
    except: One or more blocks that handle certain exception types if they are raised in the try.
    else: If present, runs only if the try block did not raise any exception.
    finally: If present, always executes after try, except, and else (if used), regardless of whether an exception was raised or not — useful for cleanup.
