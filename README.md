Q1 the difference between interpreter and compiler :
interpreter:Translates and runs code line by line,Executes the program directly without converting the entire code to machine language first,Slower because it translates code on the fly.
compiler:Translates the entire source code into machine code before running it,Generates an executable file that runs independently,Faster once compiled, since the translation happens only once.
