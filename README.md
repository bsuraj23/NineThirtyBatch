   ex:Cockroach db,google spanner
 -->In memory databases:Stored data in ram for very fast access
   ex:Redis,SAP HANA

 RAG-(How it works)
 A modern ai/ml technique often implemented using python libraries like LangChain,Haystack or Liamaindex and the abbreviation of RAG is Retrieve Augmented Generation
 -->How it works:
 Retrieve:Pulls relevant information from an external knowledge base 
 Augment:Adds that information to the user's query
 Generate:Passes it to a Large Language Model(LLM) tp produce a more accurate answer
