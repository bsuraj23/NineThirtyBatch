Recursive Data Processing:
Write a recursive function to traverse and sum all numeric values in a nested dictionary or list structure of arbitrary depth.

Regex-based Data Extraction:
Given a block of text, use regular expressions to extract all valid email addresses, phone numbers, and dates in various formats.

Custom Iterator for Fibonacci Sequence:
Implement a class that generates Fibonacci numbers up to n using the iterator protocol (__iter__ and __next__).

Advanced Exception Handling:
Design a function that reads a file, parses its contents, and handles multiple exceptions (e.g., file not found, invalid format, permission error) with custom error messages.

Assertions and Debugging:
Write a function that validates input data using assertions and logs assertion failures to a file for debugging.

Module and Package Management:
Create a package with multiple modules for mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Demonstrate importing and using these modules with aliasing and selective imports.

Class Design with Multiple Constructors:
Implement a class with multiple ways to instantiate objects (e.g., from string, from dictionary, from individual arguments) using class methods as alternative constructors.

Inheritance and Method Resolution Order (MRO):
Design a class hierarchy with multiple inheritance. Demonstrate how Python resolves method calls using MRO and the super() function.

Polymorphism with Abstract Base Classes:
Create an abstract base class for geometric shapes with abstract methods for area and perimeter. Implement concrete subclasses for circle, rectangle, and triangle.

Encapsulation and Property Decorators:
Write a class with private attributes and use property decorators to provide controlled access and validation for those attributes.

Custom Exception Class:
Define a custom exception class for invalid operations in a banking application. Use it to handle errors such as insufficient funds or invalid account numbers.

Inner Classes and Composition:
Implement a class that contains an inner class for managing related data (e.g., a Car class with an inner Engine class). Demonstrate composition and data sharing.

Garbage Collection and Destructors:
Write a class that logs messages when objects are created and destroyed. Demonstrate how Pythonâ€™s garbage collector works with object references.

Function Aliasing and Higher-Order Functions:
Show how to assign functions to variables, pass them as arguments, and return them from other functions. Use this to implement a simple plugin system.

Interface Simulation:
Simulate interfaces in Python using abstract base classes. Enforce that subclasses implement specific methods and demonstrate runtime checks.

These questions cover recursion, regex, exception handling, modules, OOP principles (class, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation), and advanced Python features.
