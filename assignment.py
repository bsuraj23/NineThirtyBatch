# Assignment Operators in Python

x = 10        # Assign 10 to variable x
print("Initial value of x:", x)  # Prints the initial value of x

x += 5        # Add 5 to x (x = x + 5)
print("After x += 5, x =", x)  # Prints the value after addition assignment

x -= 3        # Subtract 3 from x (x = x - 3)
print("After x -= 3, x =", x)  # Prints the value after subtraction assignment

x *= 2        # Multiply x by 2 (x = x * 2)
print("After x *= 2, x =", x)  # Prints the value after multiplication assignment

x /= 4        # Divide x by 4 (x = x / 4)
print("After x /= 4, x =", x)  # Prints the value after division assignment

x %= 5        # Modulus assignment (x = x % 5)
print("After x %= 5, x =", x)  # Prints the value after modulus assignment

x **= 3       # Exponent assignment (x = x ** 3)
print("After x **= 3, x =", x)  # Prints the value after exponentiation assignment

x //= 2       # Floor division assignment (x = x // 2)
print("After x //= 2, x =", x)  # Prints the value after
