# Comparison Operators in Python

a = 8  # Assign 8 to variable a
b = 5  # Assign 5 to variable b

print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)

print("a == b:", a == b)   # Checks if a is equal to b
print("a != b:", a != b)   # Checks if a is not equal to b
print("a > b:", a > b)     # Checks if a is greater than b
print("a < b:", a < b)     # Checks if a is less than b
print("a >= b:", a >= b)   # Checks if a is greater than or equal to b
print("a <= b:", a <= b)   # Checks if a is less than or equal
